# morphological analysis

For each morpheme, a speaker has memorized:
1. Phonemic representation
2. Meaning
3. Part of speech (noun, verb, …)

Terminology: `Lexicon` - The mental lexicon stores idiosyncratic information about
morphemes in memory.


### example of lexical entry 
“Cat”:
- Phonemic representation: /kæt/
- Part of speech: noun
- Meaning:meower

## forming complex words
• As we have seen, it is possible to combine meaningful parts
into complex words.

• In many cases, these meaningful parts cannot stand on
their own.

[əbl̩] with new words
[ti̵ɹl] “to rip out by the roots”

  - becomes

[ti̵ɹləbl̩] “can be ripped out by the roots


meaning: Speakers do not just have all the words with [əbl̩]
memorized. Rather, there seems to be a rule that adds [əbl̩].

Languages have productive rules for
combining meaningful parts to form complex
morphological expressions.


# terminology 
reminder 
 a morpheme is a sequence of phonemes that carries a
meaning and does not itself consist of meaningful parts.

[ɹid] and [əbl̩] are both morphemes.

Terminology: `Free morpheme`
A free morpheme can stand on its own, i.e. as a free “word”.
- examples:  [ɹid], [kæt], [aɹdvaɹk]

Terminology: `Bound morpheme`
A bound morpheme cannot stand on its own.
- Examples: [əbl̩], [nɛs]

Terminology: `affix`
a bound morpheme that attaches to a stem

Terminology: `Stem`
unit to which affix can be attached

Terminology: `root`
stem that cannot be analyzed any further into
constituent morphemes.

## roots and stems

all roots are stems but not all stems are roots
