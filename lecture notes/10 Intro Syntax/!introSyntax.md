## overview 
- Phonetics:
How are sounds articulated?
- Phonology:
How are sounds organized and manipulated?
- Morphology:
How are words built up from morphemes?
- Syntax:
How are sentences formed from words?


## core properties of syntax
- Creativity
- Category dependence
- Recursion

Speakers can understand and produce sentences that they
have never encountered before. Don't have to understand the full sentence just most words

Not every string of words in a language is a sentence of that
language:

a. A shrimp’s heart is in its head.
b. *Head a heart its shrimp’s in is.


## Syntactic categories
Words belong to classes, called `grammatical categories` (or
parts of speech).

Syntactic rules only care about these grammatical
categories, not individual words.

“snerd”:
a video game that can be completed in under 10 hours

1. This game is a real snerd.
2. Don’t buy that snerd!
3. Snerds really annoy me.
4. *I snerd every weekend.
5. *I play very snerd.

can figure out snerd is a noun based off knowledge of syntax 

### noun
Rule-of-thumb test:
can occur as X in “I heard about the X”.

Also we will assume that proper names (Alex, Taylor,
Pat, …) and pronouns (I, you, she, he, they, …) are also nouns.

### verb

Rule-of-thumb test:
can have “can” appear directly before them

### adjective 
Rule-of-thumb test:
can appear between the very and a N

### D(eterminers) + P(repositions)
Determiners:
the, that, a, some, every

Prepositions:
to, from, on, that, behind, with


## recursion
A sentence can itself contain another sentence.
- Recursion

Because of this property, sentences can be unboundedly
long.
- There is no longest sentence of English.
- There is an infinite number of English sentences.
- 
Recursion (informal definition):
something contains a version of itself

• Consequence:
Syntactic rules must be recursive.

• In other words, it must be possible for syntactic rules to
apply to their own output.
