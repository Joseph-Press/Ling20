Phonetics:
How are sounds produced?

Phonology:
What are the rules affecting how a word is pronounced?

Morphology:
What are the rules for forming words?


## english plural
Speakers have detailed knowledge about word formation

 [pʌpilɪʃəs], [hʌŋkəlɪʃəs], [buɾilɪʃəs] | nouns

*[k ͡aȷndəlɪʃəs], [hæpilɪʃə] | adjectives

*[gɹ ͡ owlɪʃəs], [dɪstɹ ͡ɔȷlɪʃəs] | verbs

*[ʌpəlɪʃəs], [ ͡ owvi̵ɹlɪʃəs] | prepositions

What is a word? easy to intuit, difficult to formally define notion of 'word'

## Hypothesis #1: Orthography (Spelling)
Hypothesis, a word is a lingusitic unit separated from other words by writing in spaces 

but... not all langauges have a standardized written tradition

not all not all languges write with spaces between words 

even in lanauges with rich written traditions orthography is a poor guide 

wallpaper, wall plug, leapfrog, leap year, blacklist, black belt, longbow,crossbow, recurve bow, compound bow

so spaces dont help much...

## hypothesis 2: internal integrity and cohesion
hypothesis:
A word is a linguistic unit that cannot be “split
apart”.

• This hypothesis makes the right distinction in some places:

a. a blue book
What color is the book? Blue.

b. a clueless student
*What less is the student? Clue.

---

a. That’s not at all possible.
b. *That’s im-at all-possible.

Cali-freaking-fornia

Who did you see?
a. the child
b. *child

## hypothesis 3: phonology

A word is a linguistic unit that is prosodically
demarcated (i.e. separated by pauses) and serves as the
domain for stress assignment.

• This hypothesis makes the right distinction in some places:

(8) a. (bláck) (bírd) a bird that is black
b. (bláck bird) a species of bird

(9) a. (wéek) (énd) the end of the week
b. (wéek end) Saturday and Sunday

• But, typical speech doesn’t really have pauses in it

Also, sometimes the domain of stress assignment seems
like more than one word

a. I’ve, she’s, could’ve, couldn’t, I’d’ve
b. (the gírl), (a gírl), (ásk her)

# Morpheme
every definition of word overgenerates or undergenerates to some degree

even though there isnt a clear def of word, there is a meaningful lingusitic unit that we can use to study morphology: morphemes

terminology" `morpheme`
a morpheme is the smallest unit of indivisible sound and meaning in a given language
